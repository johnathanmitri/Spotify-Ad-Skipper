# Spotify Ad Skipper
 C# program to skip Spotify Ads

The program sits in the system tray. When a (very annoying) ad comes on, hitting the media stop button on the keyboard closes and re-opens Spotify, and then sends a play signal to Spotify. 

The user may also left click the icon in the tray, as well as click the "Skip Ad" menu button. Spotify is closed and re-opened in the background to not disturb the user. 

Just hit the stop key when you hear an ad, and the ad will go away :)
